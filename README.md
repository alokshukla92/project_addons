# Project Addons

Custom Frappe app with enhanced project management features, including a modern weekly timesheet interface inspired by Keka's UX design.

## Features

### Weekly Timesheet (Keka-style Interface)
- **Modern Grid Interface**: Clean, tabular view showing all days of the week
- **Week Navigation**: Easy navigation between weeks with calendar picker  
- **Project/Task Selection**: Dropdown selection for projects and activity types
- **Real-time Calculations**: Automatic calculation of daily, weekly, billable, and non-billable hours
- **Integrated Data**: Fully integrated with Frappe's existing Timesheet doctype
- **Status Indicators**: Visual indicators for billable/non-billable time and submission status
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

### Key Improvements over Standard Frappe Timesheet
1. **Better UX**: Week-at-a-glance view instead of line-by-line entry
2. **Intuitive Navigation**: Calendar-based week selection
3. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status indicators and real-time totals
4. **Efficient Data Entry**: Quick time entry with smart parsing (supports formats like "1:30", "1.5", etc.)
5. **Integrated Actions**: Save, submit, copy previous week, and apply leave functionality
